# Blockchain-Technology
Repository for course BITS F452 Blockchain Technology under Prof. Geetha Kumari.
This repository consists of 2 assignments and 1 final project for the coursework.

Assignment 1 focuses on building a blockchain from scratch on python.
Assignment 2 focuses on building a smart contract on solidity.

The final project is a Game Asset Marketplace DApp, essentially an NFT market place where assets like in-game skins can be used in transactions. It is available on a seperate repository on my profile. It was made using a refernce article found online : "https://dev.to/edge-and-node/building-scalable-full-stack-apps-on-ethereum-with-polygon-2cfb"
